# Secret Number

## About

v1: Development of an application capable of communicating through the browser's "alerts" - where the user is asked what the secret number is, and the machine will give random numbers until the given user gets it right - with tips such as: whether that number is greater or smaller than the one entered by the user, known as a guess.

v2: Improvement of the previous application, this time lists and functions were implemented, based on what was previously done through alerts, this time, we have it directly on the web page, using interactivity based on input - having the same functionalities, adding a certain amount of numbers generated, so that it does not generate repeated values, when the quantity runs out, it resets the list.
